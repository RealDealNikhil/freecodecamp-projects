# freecodecamp-projects
## A fun repository by Nikhil Suri

In this repository I've stored my various creations from teaching myself web
development through [FreeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/). Most of these projects were originally created using [CodePen](https://codepen.io/). Keep reading for a description of each, and I hope that you enjoy!

* **Tribute Page:** This was one of the first HTML pages that I created using a variety of elements. It's dedicated to Aaron Copland because he's one of my favorite music composers.
* **Quote Machine:** Grabbing and presenting quotes on design and creativity. Share one on twitter if you really love it!
* **Weather Wizard:** Updating you on your local weather with some cool background images of mother nature. Switch between using Celcius and Fahrenheit units - whichever you prefer.
* **Twitch TV Viewer:** Showcasing a few channels that I found on twitch. It's still in progress.
* **Wikipedia Viewer:** Quickly find Wikipedia articles on any topic you want! This one is still in progress as well.
