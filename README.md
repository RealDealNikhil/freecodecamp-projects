# freecodecamp-projects
## by Nikhil Suri

This repository contains various projects I have made from teaching myself how to code through [FreeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/). Most of these projects were originally created using [CodePen](https://codepen.io/). Below is a description of each:

* **Tribute Page:** One of the first HTML pages that I created using a variety of elements. Dedicated to one of my favorite composers: Aaron Copland.
* **Quote Machine:** Presenting quotes on design and creativity. Share one on twitter!
* **Weather Wizard:** Updating you on local weather with relevant background images. You can switch between using Celcius and Fahrenheit units.
* **Twitch TV Viewer:** Showcasing a few channels that I found on twitch. Still in progress.
* **Wikipedia Viewer:** Quickly find Wikipedia articles on any topic you want. Still in progress.
* **node-projects:** Projects created while learning how to use node through `learnyounode`.
